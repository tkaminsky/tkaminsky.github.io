## About

**Hello! I'm Thomas Kaminsky, a senior at Harvard studying stats, math, and cs. I'm passionate about computer vision and robotics, and am excited to learn more about how we can effectively reason about the world using sense information. Welcome to my website!**


### `button.html`
A button that can link to a page of any kind.

Example usage: `{% include button.html text="I'm a button" link="https://david.darn.es" %}`

Available options:
- `text`: The text of the button _required_
- `link`: The link that the button goes to _required_
- `icon`: The icon that is added to the end of the button text
- `color`: The colour of the button

### `figure.html`
An image with optional caption.

Example usage: `{% include figure.html image="/uploads/feature-image.jpg" caption="Check out my photo" %}`

Available options:
- `image`: The image shown _required_
- `caption`: A caption to explain the image
- `position`: The position of the image; `left`, `right` or `center`
- `width` & `height`: Optional width and height attributes of the containing image

### `icon.html`
An icon.

Example usage: `{% include icon.html id="twitter" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The reference for the icon _required_
- `title`: The accessible label for the icon
- `color`: The desired colour of the icon
- `width` & `height`: Width and height attributes for the icon, default is `16`

### `nav-share.html`
A set of buttons that share the current page to various social networks, which is controlled within the `_config.yml` file under the `sharing_links` keyword.

Example usage: `{% include nav-share.html %}`

Available options:
``` yml
Twitter: "#1DA1F2"
facebook: "#3B5998"
Pinterest: "#BD081C"
LinkedIn: "#0077B5"
tumblr: "#36465D"
Reddit: "#FF4500"
HackerNews: "#ff6600"
DesignerNews: "#2D72D9"
Email: true
```

_The first item is the name of the network (must be one of the ones stated above) and the second is the colour of the button. To remove a button remove the line of the same name._

### `video.html`
A YouTube video.

Example usage: `{% include video.html id="zrkcGL5H3MU" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The YouTube ID for the video _required_

### `map.html`
A Google map. _See Google [My Maps](https://www.google.com/mymaps)_

Example usage: `{% include map.html id="1UT-2Z-Vg_MG_TrS5X2p8SthsJhc" %}`

Available options:
- `id`: The map ID for the video _required_

### `site-form.html`
Adds a contact form to the page. This can be used with [Formspree](https://formspree.io/) or [Netlify Forms](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/) depending on your setup.

Example usage: `{% include site-form.html %}`

Available options:
- `netlify_form=true`: Set whether you would like to use Netlify Forms, otherwise the form will default to Formspree
- `name`: Give the form a name, by default the form is called "Contact". The name will be reflected when form submissions come through in Netlify or in your email client. The name is also used in the label and input elements for accessibility


Use the `email` option in the `/_config.yml` to change to the desired email.

### `site-search.html`
Adds a search form to the page.

Example usage: `{% include site-search.html %}`

This include has no options. This include will add a block of javascript to the page and javascript reference in order for the search field to work correctly.

### `site-before-start.html` & `site-before-end.html`
Optional html includes for adding scripts, css, js or any embed code you wish to add to every page without the need to overwrite the entire `default.html` template.

**Example usage:** These are different to other includes as they are designed to be overwritten. If you create a `site-before-start.html` file in the `_includes/` the contents of the file will be included immediately before the closing `</head>` tag. If you create a `site-before-end.html` file the contents of the file will be included immediately before the closing `</body>` tag.

## Page layouts

As well as `page`, `post`, `blog`, there are a few alternative layouts that can be used on pages:

- `categories`: Shows all posts grouped by category, with an index of categories in a left hand sidebar
- `search`: Adds a search field to the page as well as a simplified version of the sidebar to allow more focus on the search results

## Page and Post options

There are some more specific options you can apply when creating a page or a post:

- `aside: true`: Adds a sidebar to the page or post, this is false by default and will not appear
- `comments: false`: Turns off comments for that post
- `feature_image: "/uploads/feature-image.jpg"`: Adds a full width feature image at the top of the page
- `feature_text: "Example text"`: Adds text to the top of the page as a full width feature with solid colour; supports markdown. This can be used in conjunction with the `feature_image` option to create a feature image with text over it
- `indexing: false`: Adds a `noindex` meta element to the `<head>` to stop crawler bots from indexing the page, used on the 404 page

> **Note:** The Post List Page options are actually in the collection data within the `_config.yml` file.
