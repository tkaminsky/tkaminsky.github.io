Hello!

I'm Thomas, an incoming Computer Science PhD Student at Harvard University. I am a member of [REACT Lab](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by Professor [Stephanie Gil](https://gil.seas.harvard.edu/) to develop efficient and robust algorithms for coordination in multi-robot systems. 

Previously, I studied statistics and math at Harvard, 
My senior thesis, advised by Professor [Gabriel Kreiman](https://brain.harvard.edu/?people=gabriel-kreiman), was concerned with experimentally characterizing autocurriculum learning for sparse robotics tasks---you can read it [here](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu/publications/PDFs/gk8166.pdf).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
