Hello, and thanks for checking out my website!

I'm Thomas, an incoming Computer Science PhD Student at Harvard University. I am a member of [REACT Lab](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/), advised by Professor [Stephanie Gil](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/people/stephanie-gil) to develop efficient and robust algorithms for coordination in multi-robot systems.

Previously, I studied statistics and math at Harvard.
My senior thesis, advised by Professor [Gabriel Kreiman](https://brain.harvard.edu/?people=gabriel-kreiman), was concerned with experimentally characterizing autocurriculum learning for sparse robotics tasks---if you're interested, feel free to read it [here](https://klab.tch.harvard.edu/publications/PDFs/gk8166.pdf).

I also spent time at the University of Washington as part of [UW+Amazon Science Hub](https://www.sciencehub.uw.edu/), working on problems for sensing, tracking, and manipulating unknown objects in cluttered bin scenes, and at the University of Minnesota, working with the [Robotics: Perception and Manipulation Lab](https://rpm-lab.github.io/) on understanding how to estimate the poses of unknown objects with symmetries for dual-arm grasping.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me using any of the links at the bottom of this page.
